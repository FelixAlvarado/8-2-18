what is an optimal substructure? When might a problem have one? 

A problem has the optimal subsructure proprty if an optimal solution can be obtained using the optimal solution of subproblems. 

A shortest path problem could have one: 
If x is on the shortest path from a to b, Then the shortest path from a to b would be the sum of the shortest path from a to x and the shortest path from x to b.
